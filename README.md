# BreakOutGame

I recreated this game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by following the steps in this link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Finishing_up

The game allows users to practice using different keys on their laptops in order to move blocks around.
